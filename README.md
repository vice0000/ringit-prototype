prototype for my puzzle platformer in Godot.

## instructions:
- Go to releases page
- Download the ZIP file that corresponds to your OS and CPU
- extract the files from the zip to somewhere you'd like. *MAKE SURE ALL FILES IN THE ZIP ARE EXTRACTED TO THE SAME DIRECTORY OR THE GAME WONT LOAD!*
- open the executable file (.exe on Windows, .x86_64 on linux)
- if windows screams at you ("windows protected your pc" popup) just hit **Read More** and run. its a false positive, as i havent fiddled with any publishing or anything yet
- enjoy! report bugs and send feedback on gameplay, **preferably record footage of your blind run**
