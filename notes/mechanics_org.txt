------------

- you can walk ✅
- you can jump ✅
- you can walk and jump at the same time to cross gaps ✅
- get to the goal flag! ✅
- spikes mean you cant walk there or the room progress is reset ✅
- get used to the jump & walk controls and physics, + avoiding spikes precisely ✅

------------

- theres a glowing yellow ring ✅
- yellow rings let you jump in the air when touching them & pressing jump ✅
- you can jump multiple times in the air via multiple yellow rings ✅

- you can grab the yellow rings ✅
- you can put the yellow ring somewhere else ✅
- therefore, wherever you can carry&use this ring, you practically have a double jump ✅
- you can grab and release and use as many times as you want ✅

- you can use a yellow ring to reach another yellow ring ✅
- you can only hold one ring at a time ✅
- you can use two yellow rings to jump two gaps ✅
- you can jump in the air with a yellow ring to put the second yellow ring even higher ✅
- you can, in general, arrange rings in any way you want as long as you can reach there ✅

------------

- theres a glowing blue ring ✅
- blue rings flip character gravity ✅
- youll need to get used to platforming upside down ✅
- gravity returns to normal when using a blue ring a second time ✅

- you can grab a blue ring and move it elsewhere just as you do with yellows ✅
- but if you can reach the ring after flipping gravity, you can take the ring with you easily. then: ✅
- flip gravity, take ring with you, flip gravity again, take with you again ... ad infinitum ✅
- if you flip gravity, sometimes you cant reach a blue ring again; youre too high up ✅

- yellow and blue ring can be together in the room ✅
- yellow ring works same with flipped grav; you just jump downward instead of up ✅
- when you cant reach a blue ring after flipping grav, a yellow ring can help you reach it again ✅

- the order you stack orbs now matters; a blue atop a yellow will work different than the vice versa ✅

- triple stack of orbs is even more nuanced; blue atop yellow atop yellow,yellow atop blue atop yellow,etc✅

------------

- theres a laser beam ✅
- the beam seems to rip an orb out of your hands ✅
- when you check back, the orb has teleported to the original spawnpoint; "recaller" is a fitting name ✅

- its an annoying beam that confiscates your precious toys ✅
- so initially an obstacle: DONT let the ring touch the recaller or you lose it ✅
- some puzzles that play with the recaller and make you think of it as an obstacle ✅

- practical usage revealed - this laser is your FRIEND sometimes, you can use it to TELEPORT rings ✅
- bring a blue ring somewhere, use, pass through a recaller, so you can use it again at its spawn (x)

- practice all of this knowledge for fun in some final challenge puzzles ✅
- game end?
- this is getting distant so ill stop theorizing and start doing levels

------------

MISC:

- while airborne, you can release and use an ring at the same time, never needing to touch ground.
- SPACE + MOUSE1
- (dunno where to teach this)

- after using a ring, there's a brief 0.5s moment where you cant pick it up
- (this is a cheat stopper so you cant flyhack with yellow rings)
- (i dont know where to teach this either)
